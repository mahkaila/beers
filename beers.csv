Heels to Jesus,5,Belgian Yeast & Kiwi Hops,"From the sacred to the profane. Heels to Jesus, a monastic style transposed to the iniquitous and colourful setting of Marion St. Brewed as a pure, unadulterated ale using Belgian yeasts and Kiwi hops, the contents of this bottle are changing, even as you hold it in your hand. At the moment of packaging each bottle was spiked with live Brettanomyces beginning a process whereby these funky and tenacious yeasts will change the flavour of the beer within.Drink it fresh from packaging to experience it in its pure, original form, then try it again as the months pass to be taken on a unique and unpredictable journey of transformation. Amen. Wild Workshop At Garage Project we’ve always liked pushing boundaries, reinterpreting styles and challenging the notions of what beer can be. Welcome to Marion Street, our new playground, hidden away in one of the most colourful corners of Wellington. It’s a workshop, a place where we’re free to play with wild and wonderful ways of fermenting, to push the boundaries even further. We’re here to try something new. Just like you. "
Hellbender,11.2,A Tonne of Malt and a Mountain of U.S. Hops,"You are about to be tested. Hellbender is a leviathan of a beer made with over a tonne of malt and a mountain of American hops. You know it would taste great right now, but a beer this big will only get better with age. What will it taste like in a year? Two years? More? Will you ever get to find out or will it be too much for you? Can you delay the gratification, or will you yield to temptation? Which will it be? Your time starts now."
Hop Trial No. 4,7.8,Brand Spanking New Hops,"An experimental NZIPA with tropical fruit notes, brewed especially for the Smith's NZ IPA Challenge in Queenstown in June 2017. Made with a never before released hop variety, this is as exclusive as it gets."
Hops on Pointe,6.7,Nelson Sauvin,"Beer and ballet - an unusual Pas de Deux. Brewed by Garage Project for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, Hops on Pointe teases the boundaries between high and low culture.Brewed with premium German malts, Nelson Sauvin hops and finished with a champagne yeast, the result is a pale gold lager with a crisp, clean palate, rich tropical fruit aromas and tight champagne bubbles.Available at all good barres."
L'il Red Rye,6.8,"Rye, Simcoe, Amarillo Hops","Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? Humulus Lupulus, the wolf bine can be fierce, but L'il Red Rye, the grain at the heart of this beer, has more than enough character to run with the wolves. Amarillo and Simcoe hops combine with the earthy spice of rye, and richness of Munich and caramel malts to create a beer that is well worth a short cut through the woods."
La Calavera Catrina,6.9,"Maize, Habanero Chilli, Watermelon, Rose Water","La Calavera Catrina, The Elegant Skull. The little sister to our original dead head is as blonde as Day of the Dead is dark, but don't be fooled, she's no lightweight. Brewed with maize, an ingredient you'd normally associate with much blander lager offerings, Catrina is fired up with an assertive chili heat from a generous addition of Habaneros, and spiked with rose water and yes - watermelon. The result is cheeky, complex and fiery - what more could you want in the Lady of Death?
 
The elegant skull helps us remember that ""Death brings this neutralizing force; everyone is equal in the end. This was the driving force behind brewing this beer, come celebrate and rejoice in cycle of life and death with us."
Lack of Faith,7.5,Bitterness and Power,"Give yourself to the dark side. Lack Of Faith Black IPA - the colour of space with all the bitterness and powerful hop aroma of its lighter sibling. Only at the end do you notice the power of the dark side as it finishes clean and dry without the heavy roast character of a stout or porter. Do you doubt us? We find your lack of faith disturbing. 
Originally brewed for Golding's Freedive 'May The 4th Be With You' 2015."
Lola,5.5,"Citrus, Spices, Cola Nuts, Vanilla and Whole Sour Cherries","Things are not always what they seem. Lola, cherry cola dunkel, a boundary bending, trans-style take on the classic German dark lager. Spiked with citrus, spices, cola nuts, vanilla and whole sour cherries, the result is a rich dark brown, effervescent and refreshing brew somewhere ambiguously between beer and a classic soda. It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, but it's all the more enjoyable for it. Brewed using 100% ethically sourced, fair trade cola nuts from our friends at Karma Cola. Cheers!"
Loral Royale,5.6,Loral Hops,"Buy the Ticket, take the ride. Loral Royale, a lupulin fuelled trip to resinous soul of the American IPA. Extravagantly dry hopped with newly released US hop Loral, this is a dangerously drinkable IPA with a malt bill that delivers light caramel notes backed up with a juicy, floral citrus hop punch. Remember… Good people drink good beer - Hunter S. Thompson"
Los Lobos,8,"Simcoe, Citrus, Amarillo","Los Lobos, 'the wolves' in Spanish, a California road trip inspired tribute to America's finest varieties of humulus lupulus. Simcoe, Amarillo and Citra, the holy hop trinity, shine through in a Golden State IPA of lush aroma and beguiling balance."
Louisiana Voodoo Queen,9.5,"Flight Coffee, Chicory","This bottle holds a powerful dark brew. Inspired by the tradition of New Orleans coffee and the Louisiana Voodoo 'cure-all', Voodoo Queen is a rich, dark ale, redolent in plum fruit and spice and infused with chicory root and a specially roasted batch of Brazilian beans conjured up by our friends at Fight Coffee. So lay down your three nickels and imbibe with caution - powerful forces lie within. Best enjoyed from a stemmed glass rubbed on a black cat. "
Lucky Cat,5.8,"Lychee, Mandarin","A lychee and mandarin sour brewed especially for our collaboration with Regal restaurant. During Wellington on a Plate 2017, Regal hosted us for one night only and together we put on a feast of yum cha style dining and custom-brewed beers. "

Using only the finest vacuum evaporated pure dry malt extract and Warrior, Amarillo and Simcoe liquid CO2 hop extracts, this beast of a beer weighs in at 10% abv and over 100 IBU.

A tantalizing glimpse into the unknown. Brewed for your delectation and delight, Mermaid’s Hand, a golden ale, blended with freshly crushed pear juice and fermented with the true Brettanomyces bruxellensis Trois in freshly emptied oak wine barrels. A beguiling brew, both bizarre and beautiful."
Modern Times Transit of Venus,5.4,"Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus","This sensationally tasty grisette—a sessionable relative of the saison, originally hailing from Belgium’s Hainaut province—was brought to delicious fruition via a rye-forward malt bill and a Brett-heavy amalgam of our house microflora. The resulting beer is delightfully refreshing and intriguingly complex, with a profile that’s rustic, spicy, and peppered with notes of hay and pastoral funk that rest lightly on a crisp,  lemony acidity. Its modest ABV belies the window-rattling mouth party contained within. Brace yourself."
Mon P'tit Chou,5,Saison Yeast,"Mon P’tit Chou - a term of endearment in French. Translated literally it means “my little cabbage”. Made from 100% Belgian malt and French grown Strisselspalt hops, this farmhouse style ale has a fresh sherbet aroma, and a refreshing dry, tart, palate with just a hint of orange. There are no cabbages in the beer, but there is a lot of love. A la tienne!"
Mutiny on the Bounty,11,Breadfruit,"Come on a journey below the 45th parallel. Inspired by the ill fated expedition of the HMS Bounty, Mutiny is a very South Pacific take on an export stout, brewed with breadfruit, roasted plantain, coconut sugar, toasted coconut and Tahitian vanilla. Spirituous heat elegantly balanced with deep, rich coconut vanilla sweetness in an ebony black brew of intense complexity. A voyage to the true heart of darkness."
Nectarivore,6,"Pineapple, Sage, Hibiscus ","Nectarivore - (from the Greek work nektar, the drink of the gods) a creature deriving its energy from the sugar rich nectar of flowering plants.
Colour me in. It's nectar of a new sort. Nectarivore certifed organic IPA, a big hoppy, colourful cocktail of organic New Zealand hops, Pineapple Sage and Hibiscus. There's oodles of colour inside, but we've left the outside to you. Stay in the lines, or not - it's up to you. Happy 25th birthday Common Sense Organics."
Nerissimo,5.6,"Truffle, Porcini","Porcini mushroom and black truffle. Two of the greatest prizes of the fungal kingdom, combined to create a porter possessing a unique rich, dark, earthy character. Mushroom magic meets haute cuisine."
New Belgium Citradellic,6,"Citra, Tangerine Infused Orange Peel","Tune in and hop out with New Belgium Citradelic. Set adrift on a kaleidoscopic wave of hoppiness brought to you by a mystical marriage of Citra hops and tangerine peel, which elevates each sip onto a plane of pure tropical, fruity pleasure. Citradelic’s namesake hop and fruit combine to jam with visions of additional hops like citrusy Mandarina Bavaria, tropical Azzaca, and fruity Galaxy for a colorful explosion that’s grounded by just a touch of malty sweetness. Bored by the status quo? Expand your palate with a pour of Citradelic."
Orange Sunshine,4.8,"Orange, Lemon",A supremely refreshing American-style wheat ale given an extra summery edge thanks to additions of orange and lemon zest.
Oumou,6.3,"Pineapple, Ginger","People often talk of the silk road between Asia and Europe, but the southern sea route took traders all the way down the east coast of Africa. From the great African continent we bring you Oumou. Traditionally a pineapple and ginger ‘beer’, our take on this brew is a zesty and refreshing pilsner with pronounced gingerol punch layered with pineapple fruit sweetness and aroma."
Pan Pacific,6,"Toasted Coconut, Golden Syrup, Oats","Pan Pacific is brewed with golden syrup, suggestively named Golden Naked Oats and a combination of New Zealand Motueka and Australian Galaxy hops.Pan Pacific is a rich red amber, with generous malt and fruit hop character, and a subtle hint of toasted coconut at the end of the palate. It’s a brew to meet the arrival of Autumn, with nice body and character with just a hint of warmer climes.Come fly with us."
Party & Bullshit,6.2,"Simcoe, Mosaic","East Coast anthem IPA - a big ol' hop poppa of a beer, packing in intense mango, tropical fruit hit from US big guns, Simcoe and Mosaic. It's just bigger and juicier than it's bitter West Coast counterpart, like sippin' hazy hop nectar from a can. It's all good."
Pernicious Weed,8,"Nelson Sauvin, Rakau","The arrival of hops to the brewing scene in England in the 1500s led to a moral panic, hops were described as ""a Wicked, & Pernicious Weed"", feared to bring the downfall of civilized society. Thankfully, they were right.
Pernicious Weed is a celebration of the NZ-developed hop varieties Nelson Sauvin and Rakau. Huge grapefruit flavour in a worryingly-drinkable strong IPA."
Persephone,6.2,"Pomegranate, Pink Pepper, Grapefruit Peel, Balsamic Reduction","Persephone, fated to spend eternity twixt light and darkness after eating a single pomegranate seed - her endless descent and rise causing the change of seasons. Inspired by this tale Persephone is a unique and complex Saison (the name literally meaning season) brewed with pomegranate, pink pepper, grapefruit peel and a rich balsamic reduction.

Petite Mort,5.3,Wai-iti,"The little death, a rustic but beguiling blonde farmhouse ale, fermented with a cocktail of brettanomyces and saison yeast and finished with a generous dose of Wai-iti hops. Each sip begins a little journey, at first refreshingly different and delightfully drinkable, then building with bright notes of fresh spring grass and gentle floral perfume to a peak of tart pineapple and hoppy lemon citrus. Finish and allow yourself a little moment of bliss."
Pig Squeal,6,"Soured Wort, Peckham's Cider Apple Juice","Pig Squeal, in England’s deep south it’s slang for a sour or tannic cider. The Pig Squeal in this bottle is a unique blend of beer and apple juice, cooked up in collaboration with the wonderful folk at Peckham’s Cider. Made up of one third freshly pressed cider apple juice from Harry Masters Jersey, Yarlington Mill and Sweet Coppin apples, to two thirds soured wort, co-fermented and then lightly dry hopped - the result is juicy, aromatic and refreshingly tart cross-bred beer with a surprising sour apple twist. Squeal piggy, squeal!"
Pills N Thrills,5.5,"Summit, Liberty","Out of style' according to the rule books.

Pils 'n' Thrills is the Garage's irreverent take on the classic Bohemian Pilsner. German malts combined with American Summit hops create a refreshingly crisp, golden beer with a snappy bitterness and lifter lemon citrus notes.

It's definitely not your average pilsner, but then some rules were meant to be broken."
Pony Ride,11.2,"Cola Beer, Citrus, Spices, Kola Nuts, Vanilla, Aged in Bourbon Casks","Get up on that saddle and come for a canter with Garage Project and ALC. Pony Ride - Cola beer brewed with citrus, spices, kola nuts and vanilla, and aged in bourbon casks. Is this dark horse a high brow barrel-aged take on the classic premix, or a dark detour to the shady world of the RTD? Pony up and decide for yourself. Giddy up horsey."
Rebel County,13,"Irish Malt, Maize, Hazelnut, Honey, Vanilla, Dried Apricots","Sine Metu - without fear. The Jameson family motto and the guiding principle for a collaboration unlike any we’ve done before. Jameson, Garage Project and fresh whiskey barrels from the Midleton distillery in County Cork.
A unique opportunity like this demands a unique beer.

Feel the fear, and do it anyway. Sláinte"
Resonance,6,Good Vibrations,"An experiment in sound. At its heart, Cologne classic, Kölsch, with a touch of extra hop and an unconventional symphonic twist. From propagation to packaging the yeast in Resonance has been, in sequence, sonically stimulated, energised and then soothed with a specially curated selection of classical music played directly into the beer using a submersible speaker. Bioacoustically brewed with good vibrations. Created with the help of the NZSO and their Associate Conductor Hamish McKeich."
Rose De La Valle,9,"Escarpment, Pinot Noir Juice, Conditioned on Pinot Noir Skins","Rosé de la Vallée, the third in our trilogy of beers celebrating each year's grape harvest. At it's heart it's a crisp pale pilsner infused with freshly crushed Pinot juice from Martinborough's award winning Escarpment Winery. The beer was then rested on the red Pinot skins for 48 hours, just enough time to lend the brew what in Rosé parlance is described as 'onion skin' orange with a light blush of pink and delightful crisp citrus and strawberry notes."
Rum & Raisin,11.5,"Raisins, Aged in Carribean Rum For 18 Months","Brewed with specially selected malts and yeast for a unique plum fruit character, then aged for 18 months on organic raisins in freshly emptied Caribbean rum barrels. The ultimate decadent desert island beer."
Sea of Green,5.8,"Fresh Motueka, Riwaka, Wakatu","Only once a year do you get a chance to brew a beer like this. Sea of Green, inspired by a hopback awash with the exuberant, almost luminous green of fresh hop cones, not dried but chilled and rushed straight from the harvest to the brewery. The result, a fresh, crisp Pilsner bursting with the unique aroma and flavour of freshly harvested New Zealand hops. Dive in."
Sorachi Sisters,7.7,Sorachi Ace,IPA brewed with Japanese hop Sorachi Ace and two of its sisters developed in 1984 by Sapporo Breweries Ltd. Quite possibly the first time they have all been used in one beer. The result is a unique hop character almost reminiscent of melons and citrus.
Tangerine Kaleidoscope,5.6,"Mandarin, Tangerine","Clean sharp bitterness balanced with a touch of malt sweetness. Generously hopped with a blend of high citrus New Zealand, Australian, American and German hop varieties and infused with mandarin and tangerine. The resulting beer is a clean, juicy IPA with a pronounced citrus fruit and hop aroma, and a delicious tangerine tang."
Tempest Prognosticator,7.5,"Bitter Dark Choc, Burnt Mandarin Foam","The marvellous Tempest Prognosticator, a machine of unsurpassed ingenuity, harnessing the uncanny precognitive abilities inherent in the natural world for the benefit of science and mankind. Dark clouds gather. There’s a storm brewing. Tempest Prognosticator, a luscious robust porter, infused with finest cocoa nibs, cinnamon, vanilla and hand roasted burned mandarin. Prepare yourself, we’re in for wild weather."
The Aardvark,4,"Lemongrass, Ants","Consider the Aardvark (Orycteropus afer), a specimen whose visage seems to defy the very laws of nature and whose insatiable appetite for ants is legendary. Contained within this bottle is beer unlike any you’ve tried before. Flavoured with Lemongrass Ants the result is a startling citrus sour, to our knowledge unique in the world of brewing. Truly a treat for the brave soul with an enquiring mind and curious nature."
Tournesol,6.5,"Saison Yeast, White Pepper, Coriander, Citrus","Le Tournesol, the sunflower - a crisp, rustic and refreshingly tart Saison with a bright, sunny disposition. Golden, yellow like its namesake, Tournesol is brewed with pilsner and rye malts and lightly spiced with white pepper, coriander and citrus. The perfect refreshing beer for a summer's day - or to bring a little bit of sunshine, wherever you are."
Umami Monster,9,"Kombu, Katsuoboshi, Sea Water","It came from the deep. Brewed for GABS 2014, using New Zealand grown Kombu (kelp), Japanese Katsuobushi (dried fermented bonito flakes), smoked malt and seawater in an attempt to capture that most elusive and enigmatic of flavours - umami. Far beyond the boundaries of the accepted and expected, these ingredients combine to create a monster of dark savoury smoke and rich umami complexity. Dear God - what have we created? Definitely not suitable for vegans - sorry."
