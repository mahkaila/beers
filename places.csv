Te Papa,Museum,Cable,"Te Papa is Wellington's 'must-see' attraction, for reasons well beyond the fact that it's New Zealand's national museum. It's highly interactive, fun, and full of surprises: aptly, ‘Te Papa Tongarewa’ loosely translates as ‘treasure box’. The riches inside include an amazing collection of Māori artefacts and the museum’s own colourful marae (meeting house); natural history and environment exhibitions; Pacific and NZ history galleries; the National Art Collection; and themed hands-on ‘discovery centres’ for children. Big-name temporary exhibitions incur an admission fee, although general admission is free. You could spend a day exploring Te Papa’s six floors and still not see it all. To cut to the chase, head to the information desk on level two and collect a map. For exhibition highlights and to get your bearings, the one-hour ‘Introducing Te Papa’ tour (adult/child $15/7) is a good idea; tours leave from the info desk at 10.15am, noon and 2pm daily. 'Māori Highlights' tours ($20/10) run at 2pm daily. Two cafes and two gift shops complete the Te Papa experience, which could well consume a couple of rainy-day visits. The museum's current star attraction is the state-of-the-art exhibition 'Gallipoli: The Scale of Our War', charting the country's involvement in WWI's Gallipoli campaign through the experiences of eight ordinary New Zealanders; key to the exhibition's impact are the hyper-real models produced by Weta Workshop, which bring it all to life. The museum will host the exhibition until 2018."
Zealandia,Wildlife reserve,Waiapu,"This groundbreaking eco-sanctuary is hidden in the hills about 2km west of town: the Karori bus (No 3) passes nearby, or see the Zealandia website for info on the free shuttle. Living wild within the fenced valley are more than 30 native bird species, including rare takahe, saddleback, hihi and kaka, as well as tuatara and little spotted kiwi. An excellent exhibition relays NZ’s natural history and world-renowned conservation story. More than 30km of tracks can be explored independently, or on regular guided tours. The night tour provides an opportunity to spot nocturnal creatures including kiwi, frogs and glowworms (adult/child $75/36). Cafe and shop on-site."
City Gallery Wellington,Gallery ,Civic Square Wakefield,"Housed in the monumental old library in Civic Sq, Wellington’s much-loved City Gallery does a cracking job of securing acclaimed contemporary international exhibitions, as well as unearthing up-and-comers and supporting those at the forefront of the NZ scene. Charges may apply for major exhibits; the Nikau Cafe compensates."
Wellington Botanic Gardens,Gardens ,Glenmore,"These hilly, 25-hectare botanic gardens can be almost effortlessly visited via the Wellington Cable Car (nice bit of planning, eh?), although there are several other entrances hidden in the hillsides. The gardens boast a tract of original native forest, the beaut Lady Norwood Rose Garden, 25,000 spring tulips and various international plant collections. Add in fountains, a playground, sculptures, a duck pond, a cafe and city skyline views, and you’ve got a grand day out indeed."
Mt Victoria Lookout,viewpoint ,Lookout,"The city's most accessible view point is atop 196m-high Mt Victoria, east of the city centre. You can take the No 20 bus most of the way up, but the rite of passage is to sweat it out on the walk (ask a local for directions or just follow your nose). If you’ve got wheels, take Oriental Pde along the waterfront and then scoot up Carlton Gore Rd. Awesome views and actually rather interesting info panels."
Wellington Cable Car,Cable car,Cable Car Lane Lambton,"One of Wellington’s big-ticket attractions is the little red cable car that clanks up the steep slope from Lambton Quay to Kelburn. At the top are the Wellington Botanic Gardens, the Carter Observatory and the small but nifty Cable Car Museum. The latter evocatively depicts the cable car’s story since it was built in 1902 to open up hilly Kelburn for settlement. Ride the cable car back down the hill, or wander down through the gardens."
Weta Cave,Museum,Camperdown Weka,"Film buffs will dig the Weta Cave, a mind-blowing minimuseum of the Academy Award–winning special-effects company that brought The Lord of the Rings, King Kong, The Adventures of Tintin and The Hobbit to life. Learn how they do it on 45-minute guided tours, starting every half-hour. Weta Cave is 9km east of the city centre: drive, ride your bike, catch the Miramar bus (No 2) or book transport with your admission. Book online."
